# Pomodoro Timer 

This app is built using React, Redux, and TypeScript to help you manage your work and break time effectively. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work down into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

To use the Pomodoro Timer, <kbd><a href="https://uuuuuvika.github.io/pomodoro/">click here</a></kbd> and set the desired amount of work time and break time intervals in minutes. Then click on the start button to begin the timer. You can also pause and resume the timer at any point, as well as reset it to the default settings. You can then navigate away from the page (but don't close the tab). The timer will notify you when the work session is finished and the break has begun and vice versa.
